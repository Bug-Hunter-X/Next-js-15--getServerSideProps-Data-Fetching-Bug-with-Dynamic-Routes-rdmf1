# Next.js 15: getServerSideProps Data Fetching Bug with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 related to data fetching within `getServerSideProps` when using dynamic routes. The bug manifests when the data fetching logic relies on route parameters, and it doesn't handle edge cases or rapid data changes appropriately.  This leads to unexpected behavior or errors.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with improved error handling and data management.

## Bug Description
The core issue involves inconsistent data fetching based on route parameters.  Race conditions or improper handling of API responses can lead to stale data or errors being presented to the user.

## Solution
The solution involves robust error handling and potentially using a more resilient data fetching strategy that takes into account potential issues like API latency or data unavailability.  Always validate your data and provide appropriate fallback mechanisms.
